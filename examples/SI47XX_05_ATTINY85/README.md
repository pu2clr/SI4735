# Examples of using the Si4735 Arduino Library on ATtiny84




# SI47XX 08 - AM/FM receiver with ATtiny85  


This example implements an AM and FM receiver using the ATtiny85 as the master MCU.

The Attiny core board/plataform can be installed using the Arduino IDE boards manager. Insert the URL http://drazzy.com/package_drazzy.com_index.json on board manager.

On menu Preferences, enter the above URL in "Additional Boards Manager URLs;
To setup ATtiny85 on Arduino IDE, go to Tools Menu, Board, Board Manager and install "ATTinyCore by Spence Konde". See also the video [How to "SI4735 Arduino Library and ATtiny85"](https://youtu.be/zb9TZtYVu-s).

See [ATTiny Core - 1634, x313, x4, x41, x5, x61, x7, x8 and 828 for Arduino](https://github.com/SpenceKonde/ATTinyCore).

### ATtiny85 Schematic


The pull-up resistor values may vary depending on the devices connected to the I2C bus. Select the lowest possible resistors. The schematic below show 4.7K for pull-up resistors. However, it can be lower than it.
