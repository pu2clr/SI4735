# Arduino / ATmega328 with Nokia 5110


The schematics shown here use the SI4735-D60 device. If you use the SI4732-A10, please check the ["SI4735-D60 and SI4732-A10 replacement" table](https://github.com/pu2clr/SI4735/tree/master/extras/schematic#si4735-and-si4732-pinout).  


## Example ALL_IN_ONE_7_BUTTONS (One encoder and 7 buttons) 


This example uses the Adafruit libraries __Adafruit_GFX__ and __Adafruit_PCD8544__. 
The receiver works on VFH/FM (broadcast stations), and LW, MW and SW on AM and SSB modes.

* (*1) You have to press the push button and after, rotate the encoder to select the parameter. After you activate a command by pressing a push button, it will keep active for 2,5 seconds.
* (*2) The SEEK direction is based on the last movement of the encoder. If the last movement of the encoder was clockwise, the SEEK will be towards the upper limit. If the last movement of the encoder was counterclockwise, the SEEK direction will be towards the lower limit.
* (*3) - If you are using the SI4732-A10, check the corresponding pin numbers.
* (*4) - If you are using the SI4735-D60, connect the SEN pin to the ground; If you are using the SI4732-A10, connect the SEN pin to the +Vcc.



## User instructions 


1. BAND, MODE, AGC/Attenuation, bandwidth and STEP

Press the the correspondent push button and after, rotate the encoder to select the option. For example: 
To switch the band, press the band button and then rotate the encoder clockwise or counterclockwise. 
The display will show you the current band. 

To switch the mode (AM, LSB or USB), press mode button and then rotate the encoder.

You can adjust AGC/Attenuation, STEP, and Bandwidth in a similar fashion.

Tip: Press and release the push button quickly. If you hold the button down, the microcontroller will think the button is being rapidly pressed, this will make it rapidly alternate whichever setting the button was operating. Just a quick press and release is the best way to operate the button.


2. SEEK COMMAND

The seek button should be used to find a station. The seek direction is based on the last encoder movement.
Clockwise will cause a seek up, counterclockwise will cause a seek down.


3. VFO/VFO Switch 

To control the VFO and BFO, used the encoder push button. The display will show if you are using VFO or BFO.



## Example ALL_IN_ONE_ENCODER_RDS 

This example uses the Adafruit library __LCD5110_Graph__ to control the Nokia 5110 display. 
It is not available on Arduino IDE. To install __LCD5110_Graph__ library, download that library on [Rinky-Dink Eletronics](http://www.rinkydinkelectronics.com/library.php?id=47) site, unzip the file and move the folder unzipped to your Arduino Libraries folder. 


The receiver works on VFH/FM (broadcast stations), and  LW,MW and SW on AM and SSB modes.

### User Instructions


1. BAND SELECTION

   * Select the band by pressing the encoder push button once and then rotate the encoder clockwise or counterclockwise.
   * When the desired band is shown on display, you  can press the button once again or wait for about 2 seconds.
   * You will notice the control will go back to the VFO.

2. STEP, MODE, SEEK UP, SEEK DOWN, AGC/Attenuation, bandwidth, Soft Mute and VOLUME

     * Press the encoder push button twice (within 1/2 second).
     * After that, the display will show you the Menu text. Rotate the encoder clockwise or counterclockwise to select the option (STEP, MODE, AGC/Attenuation, bandwidth, VOLUME, etc).
     * After that, select the option you want to setup by pressing the encoder push button once again.
     * After that, rotate the encoder clockwise or counterclockwise to select the parameter.
     * Finally, you can press the button once again or wait for about 2 seconds.
     * The control will go back to the VFO.  

3. VFO/BFO Switch

    * Press the encoder push button twice (within 1/2 second).
    * Rotate the encoder clockwise or counterclockwise and go to the BFO option. This option is shown only on SSB mode.
    * Press the encoder push button once again.
    * Rotate the encoder clockwise or counterclockwise to increment or decrement the BFO (select the offset).
    * If you press the button again or stop rotating the encoder for about 2 seconds, the control will go back to the VFO.

__ATTENTION__: Press and release the push button quickly. If you hold the button down, the microcontroller will think the button is being rapidly pressed, this will make it rapidly alternate whichever setting the button was operating. Just a quick press and release is the best way to operate the button

4. EEPROM RESET

   The main information of the receiver is stored into the Arduino EEPROM. This way, when you turn the receiver on, the last receiver status is rescued. To RESET the receiver to DEFAULT status, turn it on with the encoder push button pressed. Check the message "EEPROM RESETED".
