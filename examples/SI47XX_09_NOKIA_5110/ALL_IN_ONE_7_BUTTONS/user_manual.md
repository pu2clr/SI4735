## User manual

1. BAND, MODE, AGC/Attenuation, bandwidth and STEP
   
    Press the push button, and then rotate the encoder to select the option.
   
    For example:
   
   * To switch the band, press the band button and then rotate the encoder clockwise or counterclockwise.
     The display will show you the current band.
   
   * To switch the mode (AM, LSB or USB), press mode button and then rotate the encoder.
   
   * Adjust the AGC/Attenuation, STEP, and Bandwidth settings using the same process.
     
     __Tip:__ Press and release the push button quickly. If you hold the button down, the microcontroller will think the button is being rapidly pressed, this will make it rapidly alternate whichever setting the button was operating. Just a quick press and release is the best way to operate the button.

2. SEEK COMMAND
   
    The seek button should be used to find a station. The seek direction is based on the last encoder movement.
    TO seek up, turn clockwise. To seek down, turn counterclockwise.

3. VFO/VFO Switch
   
    To control the VFO and BFO, used the encoder push button. The display will show if you are using VFO or BFO.
