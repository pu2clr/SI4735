### BAND, MODE, AGC/Attenuation, bandwidth, and STEP

Press the desired command push button, and then, use the encoder to select the option you want. For example:
To switch the band, press the band button and then rotate the encoder clockwise or counterclockwise.
The display will show you the current band. If you are on AM mode, you can use also the encoder push
button to select the band.

To switch the mode (AM, LSB or USB), press mode button and then rotate the encoder.

The same method can be used to change the AGC/Attenuation, STEP, and Bandwidth settings.

__Tip:__ Try to quickly press and release the push button. If you hold down the button for an extended time, the system could accidentally register extra button presses.

### SEEK COMMAND

The seek button should be used to find a station. The seek direction is based on the last encoder movement.
To seek up, turn clockwise. To seek down, turn counterclockwise.

### VFO/VFO Switch

To control the VFO and BFO, used the encoder push button. The display will show if you are using VFO or BFO.
__Note:__ This action only works in SSB mode.
