# Basic Examples

This folder has some basic examples that will help you to test your board.

__All sketches of this folder have been successfully tested on Pro Mini 3.3V, UNO (by using a voltage converter), Arduino Yún (by using a voltage converter), Arduino Micro (see the operating voltage of your Micro), Arduino Mega (by using a voltage converter), Arduino DUE, and ESP32 (Dev Kit and LOLIN32 WEMOS)__

__Regarding SSB support, the SSB patch content is not part of this library__. The patches used here were made available by Mr. [Vadim Afonkin](https://youtu.be/fgjPGnTAVgM) on his [Dropbox repository](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/xzofrl8rfaaqh59/AAA5au2_CVdi50NBtt0IivyIa?dl=0). Please note that the author of this library does not encourage anyone to use the SSB patches content for commercial purposes. __In other words, while this library supports SSB patches, the patches themselves are not a part of this library__.

The table below shows the Si4735 and Arduino Pro Mini pin connections

| Si4735 pin     | Arduino Pin |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| RESET (pin 15) | 12          |
| SDIO (pin 18)  | A4          |
| SCLK (pin 17)  | A5          |

## Example 01 - SI4735_01_POC

Test and validation of the SI4735 Arduino Library. It is a receiver for FM, MW and SW (from 1.7MHz to 30MHz).
With this sketch, you only need the Arduino IDE and its Serial monitor to test and control the circuit.
This means:

1) You don't need buttons, rotary encoders, potentiometers, etc. to control the circuit  
2) You don't need a screen to see output from the Arduino board  
3) All functions supported by this sketch can be accessed over the serial monitor  

__This sketch has been successfully tested on Pro Mini 3.3V, UNO (by using a voltage converter), Arduino Yún (by using a voltage converter), Arduino Micro (see the operating voltage of your Micro), Arduino Mega (by using a voltage converter), Arduino DUE, and ESP32 (LOLIN32 WEMOS)__

I strongly recommend starting with this sketch. This example is a proof of concept of SI4735 Arduino Library. The sketch of this example uses just the __Serial Monitor__ and works only on your __Arduino IDE__. However, you can easily replace the Serial Monitor functions to the device functions that you want to use.

## Example 02 - SI4735_02_POC_SW

This example shows how can you use SW features of the Si4735 Arduino Library. Like the previous exemple (Proof of Concept), the sketch of this example __works only on Arduino IDE__. It uses the Serial Monitor to get the commands and show the information.

## Example 03 - SI4735_03_POC_SSB

This example shows how can you use SSB features of the Si4735 Arduino Library. It uses the Serial Monitor to get the commands and show the information.

__This sketch has been successfully tested on Pro Mini 3.3V, UNO (by using a voltage converter), Arduino Yún (by using a voltage converter), Arduino Micro (see the operating voltage of your Micro), Arduino Mega (by using a voltage converter), Arduino DUE, and ESP32 (LOLIN32 WEMOS)__

This sketch will download a SSB patch to your SI4735 device (patch_full.h or patch_init.h). It can take up to 15KB of the Arduino memory.

In this context, a patch is a piece of software used to change the behavior of the SI4735 device.
There is little information available about patching the SI4735. The following information is the understanding of the author of
this project and is not necessarily correct.

A patch is executed internally (run by internal MCU) of the device. Usually, patches
are used to fix bugs or add improvements and new features over what the firmware installed
in the internal ROM of the device offers. Patches for the SI4735 are distributed in binary
form and are transferred to the internal RAM of the device by the host MCU (in this case, Arduino boards).

Since the RAM is volatile memory, the patch stored into the device gets lost when you turn off
the system. Consequently, the content of the patch has to be transferred to the device every
time the device is powered up.

__ATTENTION:__ The author of this project cannot guarantee that procedures shown
here will work in your development environment. Proceed at your own risk.
This library works with the I²C communication protocol to send an SSB extension
PATCH to SI4735-D60 and SI4732-A10 devices. Once again, the author disclaims any
and all liability for any damage or effects this procedure may have on your devices.
Procced at your own risk.

Features of this sketch:

1) Internal Arduino pull-up (no external resistors on schematic for buttons and encoder)  

2) Only SSB (LSB and USB)  

3) Audio bandwidth filter 0.5, 1, 1.2, 2.2, 3 and 4kHz  

4) Ten ham radio bands pre configured  

5) BFO Control

6) Frequency step switch (1, 5 and 10kHz)  
   
   Main Parts:
   Encoder with push button
   Seven bush buttons
   OLED Display with I2C protocol
   Arduino Pro mini 3.3V

| b   | decrement the BFO                                   |
| G   | switches on/off the Automatic Gain Control          |
| S   | switches the frequency increment and decrement step |
| s   | switches the BFO increment and decrement step       |
| X   | shows the current status                            |
| H   | shows this help                                     |
