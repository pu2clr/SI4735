This is a standalone library that contains both graphics functions
and the TFT ST7735 driver library.

This library has been derived from the Adafruit_GFX and driver library with
further code from other authors.

New functions have been added in particular it contains proportional fonts
in addition to the original Adafruit font.

Note: This version of the library might not be fully compatible with the original.


===============================================================
Hereafter is the original README text for the Adafruit library:
===============================================================

This is the core graphics library for all our displays, providing
a common set of graphics primitives (points, lines, circles, etc.).

It needs to be paired with a hardware-specific library for each
display device we carry (to handle the lower-level functions).

Adafruit invests time and resources providing this open source
code, please support Adafruit and open-source hardware by
purchasing products from Adafruit!
