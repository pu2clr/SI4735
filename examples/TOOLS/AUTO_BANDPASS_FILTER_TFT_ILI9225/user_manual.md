# User manual

### 1. BAND, MODE, AGC/Attenuation, bandwith and STEP

Press the desired command push button and after, rotate the encoder to select the option you want. For example:
To switch the band, press the band button and then rotate the encoder clockwise or counterclockwise.
The display will show you the current band. If you are in AM mode, you can use also the encoder push
button to select the band.

To switch the mode (AM, LSB or USB), press mode button and then rotate the encoder.

Use the same procedure to set the AGC/Attenuation, STEP and Bandwith options.

**Tip:** Do not hold down the push button for too long, or the system may interpret it as repeated presses. This may cause it to rapidly toggle (enable and disable) the selected option.


### 2. SEEK COMMAND

The seek button should be used to find a station. The seek direction is based on the last encoder movement.
Rotate clockwise to seek upwards, rotate counterclockwise to seek down.


### 3. VFO/VFO Switch

To control the VFO and BFO, used the encoder push button. The display will show if you are using VFO or BFO.
Note: This action only works in SSB mode.
