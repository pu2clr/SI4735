Main idea is to assign different functions to buttons for shortpress (click) or longpress events.

That change is not applicable to the library self, but to the API of the device.

Since I have an ATS-20 (with Arduino NANO), I used the example from 
/examples/SI47XX_KITS/AliExpress/SI473X_ALL_IN_ONE_OLED_RDS_CHINESE_V7/ as starting point.

However, the changes should work on any Arduino-Variant...
I have changed the band-table, so you probably want to reset EEPROM after uploading this version...

To play around (i. e. with the timings), you can switch on Serial output by setting the define "#define DEBUG"
in the main *.ino file. If set, that will switch on Serial output at 115200 baud.
If you define (in addition) "#define DEBUG_BUTTONS_ONLY" the software compiled will just report on the button 
presses to Serial (but will not start the radio/display at all).

With a shortpress (click), the functionality is usally retained as before (i. e. toggle a specific function to to be controlled by the encoder).

For longpress the following applies:
- Band+/Band- and Vol+/Vol- are back to Band/Volume Up/Down (but at a faster speed, volume can swipe throught the whole range in 3 seconds)
- The Encoder button can be longpressed to Mute/Unmute the radio
- For buttons with one functionality (bandwidth), a longpress will change between the possible values by the following logic:
    - if the current value is at either end at the range, it will start to run in the other direction
    - if it is somewhere in between, the direction will change between presses
    - it will not wrap around but stop at either the upper or lower bound (depending on direction)
- For the Mode-Button, longpress will be just like a shortpress.

For details see updates in user_manual.txt.

Some things changed in addition:
- disableCommand(NULL, ...) is called cyclically in the main loop() (see "if (coundRSSI++ > 3)") near the end.
  This call was updating the whole screen, even if there is no change needed. That resulted in a flickering of 
  the display.
  This constant refresh is not needed as far as I can tell. I disabled it within the function "disableCommand()"
  using the flag "anyOn". Works OK for me but may be I am missing something here!?  
- Volume display on screen was wrong if set below "10". Due to missing padding the values shown below "10" where 
  "90" to "00". Fixed in "showVolume()"
- removed some delay()-calls along the way. I guess the radio is now reacting faster also on encoder turns.
