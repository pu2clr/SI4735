# AliExpress Kit

The kit below is sold on Aliexpress and eBay.  Although the author of this KIT does not explicitly mention that the sketch used by the KIT is based on this library (PU2CLR SI4735 Arduino Library), I’ve been testing successfully the sketch of this folder on some KITs acquired by some Brazilians. __The author of this library is only making this sketch available. It is important that you understand that there is no guarantee that this sketch will work correctly in your KIT__.
