# User manual

1. BAND, MODE, AGC/Attenuation, bandwidth and STEP
   
   Press the desired command push button, and then rotate the encoder to select the option you want. 
   
   For example:
   To switch the band, press the band button and then rotate the encoder clockwise or counterclockwise.
   The display will show you the current band. If you are on AM mode, you can use also the encoder push button to select the band.
   
   To switch the mode (AM, LSB or USB), press mode button and then rotate the encoder.
   
   The same method works to change the AGC/Attenuation, STEP, and Bandwidth settings.
   
   __Tip:__ Try press and release the push button quickly. If you hold the button too long, then the board may randomly alternate the command status (enable and disable).

2. SEEK COMMAND
   
   The seek button should be used to find a station. The seek direction is based on the last encoder movement.
   If clockwise, the system seeks up. If counterclockwise, the system seeks down.

3. VFO/VFO Switch
   
   To control the VFO and BFO, used the encoder push button. The display will show if you are using VFO or BFO.
   This action will only work on SSB mode.
