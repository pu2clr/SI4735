# Preface

|          |            |
|----------|------------|
|  ![SI4735 Prototypes](extras/images/multiplatform_SI47XX_photo_05.png)  | This document is aimed at the Arduino developers, radio experimenters, hobbyists and anyone interested in building a receiver based on the Si473X IC family from Silicon Labs. This project is an Arduino library for the SI473X BROADCAST AM, SSB and FM/RDS RADIO RECEIVERS. Frequency ranges of AM and SSB modes are 150kHz to 30MHz, and FM mode is 64 to 108 MHz.|



<BR>

This library is intended to provide an easy-to-use interface for controlling the SI47XX (including the boards ["PL102BA-S V:2.1 10628"](https://pu2clr.github.io/SI4735/extras/BOARD_PL102BA/) and ["NE928-10A V:01"](https://pu2clr.github.io/SI4735/extras/BOARD_NE928_10A_V_01/) based on SI4730) by using Arduino platform. [It also has support to the SSB mode on SI4735-D60 and SI4732-A10 devices](https://pu2clr.github.io/SI4735/#si4735-patch-support-for-single-side-band). __The communication protocol used by this library is the I²C__. 

This library was built based on ["AN332 Si47XX PROGRAMMING GUIDE REV 1.0"](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~traylor/ece473/data_sheets/AN332.pdf) and __AN332 REV 0.8 UNIVERSAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE AMENDMENT FOR SI4735-D60/SI4732-A10 SSB AND NBFM PATCHES__. It also can be used on __all members of the SI473X family__ respecting, of course, the features available in each IC version.

## About Me

I hold a Master's degree in Educational Technology from the Federal University of Ceará, where I delved into the ways technology can enhance learning experiences. My passion for computer science led me to specialize in it, focusing on Distributed Systems Development with an Object-Oriented approach, at the University of Brasília. My academic journey began with a Bachelor's degree in Information Systems from the União Pioneira de Integração Social (UPIS-Brasília). Outside the classroom, my main hobbies are electronics and Amateur Radio.

## Attention
* __The SI473X device can work from 1.6V to 3.6V. If you are not using a 3.3V Arduino board, that Arduino will send 5V signals to the SI473X device through the digital pins and the I2C bus. That configuration can make the system unstable or damage the Si473X device__. To fix this, use a logic shifter chip that converts between 3.3V and 5V logic.  
* __This library has been successfully tested on many boards including:  ESP32; STM32; Mega 2560;  DUE; ATmega328 and Atmega32u4 based boards; ATtiny85, Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040) and more__. See [Boards where this library has been successfully tested](https://pu2clr.github.io/SI4735/#boards-where-this-library-has-been-successfully-tested).  
* __The Si47XX IC family  functionalities__ can be seen in the comparison matrix shown in table 1 (__Product Family Function__); pages 2 and 3 of the [“Si47XX PROGRAMMING GUIDE; AN332 (REV 1.0)”](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~traylor/ece473/data_sheets/AN332.pdf).


## Why do skilled developers generally use libraries?

Technically, no Arduino application needs a library. In some cases, not using libraries may be the correct decision. But there are some good reasons to consider using a library.

Libraries typically allow for easier design and maintenance of code. A library may also implement the functionality you need on multiple hardware choices, thus making the code more portable.

Imagine that you want to use an LCD or other display device in a project that monitors temperature and atmospheric pressure conditions. There are several good libraries for display devices available for Arduino users, and most of the features you might want are implemented in these libraries. There is no point in re-inventing the wheel by avoiding a library. Unless you require a feature that no library supports, it is generally wise to use a library, especially since a library can make porting code to different hardware easier.

Use of a library can reduce programming complexity and boost application robustness. It makes life easier for other developers, and also for yourself. You do not have to be a software engineer to understand why this is the case. A library, in this way, is similar to an IC. It is often possible to manually implement the functionality of many IC chips in a circuit, but doing so would dramatically increase the cost, complexity, size, and sometimes the failure rate of a project. Circuits are often better when some functions are abstracted away inside an off-the-shelf IC chip. The user of an IC only needs to know how to interact with the chip, and not how the chip itself is wired.

Finally, if you already use a library to handle the I2C bus (Wire.h), TFT, OLED, SPI devices, and Serial UART communication, then it makes sense to use a library to handle the SI473X devices. The PU2CLR Arduino Library can offer more comfort, development agility, and robustness to your project. Unlike closed-source solutions, this library is open-source. This means you can learn how the library works by studying the code, if you choose.

## SI4735 Library construction history

I began my journey to create an Arduino library for the SI473X family of devices in early November 2019. The initial plan was to construct a receiver using an Arduino board, a handful of components, and the SI4735 device manufactured by Silicon Labs. After watching some videos on YouTube, it became clear that a receiver based on the SI4735-D60 had the potential to exceed the original scope of the project—__it could even receive amateur radio and citizens band stations in SSB mode__. Through forums and websites, I discovered a significant demand from hobbyists and experimenters interested in using the SI4735 device, particularly for SSB mode. With this in mind, I shifted my focus. Instead of merely developing a basic receiver around the SI4735, __I opted to create a comprehensive Arduino library that would fully support not only the SI4735 but the entire SI473X device family__.


With this library, more than 60 examples were developed using various display types. [These examples can assist the experimenter in building their own receiver](https://github.com/pu2clr/SI4735/tree/master/examples).

Judging by the groups created around the SI47XX devices, I estimate that this library is currently being used by thousands of experimenters, applications and commercial receivers. If you are an experimenter or a radio enthusiast and want to try to build your own receiver based on the SI473X devices, then this library is for you.  

The following video is a little joke that shows the trajectory of the construction of this library. [__"PU2CLR SI4735 Arduino Library. IT IS OPEN SOURCE IT IS FREE. IT IS FOR YOU"__](https://www.youtube.com/embed/aB02Qry5-bU).

## About the SI4732 and SI4735  

The SI4732-A10 and SI4735-D60 are DSP receivers IC from Silicon Labs. They have great performance on AM, SSB (LW/MW/SW) from 150kHz to 30MHz and FM (VHF) from 64 to 108 MHz. __It is important to note that the engineers and programmers at Silicon Labs did an excellent job by implementing all the internal resources in this IC family. This library implements just the interface that allows you to use the SI473X resources with Arduino based board controller__. 
The SI473X can be programmed by sending commands and getting responses. You can control it via a microcontroller like Arduino using I²C communication protocol. To make the SI473X perform an action, the microcontroller has to send a set of bytes (command and arguments) that the device interprets and executes the given command. The image below illustrates the interaction between the MCU and the SI473X device.

### Interaction between Arduino based board and SI473X devices via  I²C  interface

![SI473x Block Diagram](extras/images/I2C_MCU_SI473X.png)


<BR>

### Functional Block Diagram

The image below shows the SI473X-D60 block diagram. It was extracted from Silicon Labs Si4730/31/34/35-D60 / BROADCAST AM/FM/SW/LW RADIO RECEIVER (page 21). __Note that the author of this Library highlights in red the pin operating voltages that can be connected to the Arduino__. Be aware of the operating voltage of the Arduino pins you will use in your project. Preferably use an Arduino with 3.3V operating voltage. If you are not using a 3.3V version of Arduino, you must use a kind of 5V to 3.3V converter on RST, SCLK, SDIO and SEN (depending on your project). 


![SI473x Block Diagram](extras/images/block_diagram.png)


According to the Si47XX PROGRAMMING GUIDE/AN332, the Si4732-A10 has the same firmware FMRX component and AM_SW_LW RX component as that of Si4735-D60. It is considered as the most recent revision as D60. So, __all descriptions related to the SI4735-D60 also apply to Si4732-A10__. __Including SSB patch support__. See the Si4732-A10 block diagram below.  


![SI4732-A10 Block Diagram](extras/images/si4732_A10_diagram.png)


#### SI4735-D60 and SI4732-A10 I²C bus address 

While the Si4735-D60 provides the 0x11 I²C bus address when the SEN pin is connected to the ground, the SI4732-A10 provides the same address when the SEN pin is connected to the +VCC.  Also, this library provides the function __getDeviceI2CAddress__ to detect the I²C bus address automatically. This way, you don't need to worry about this setup if you use this function. See [getDeviceI2CAddress()](https://pu2clr.github.io/SI4735/extras/apidoc/html/group__group05.html#ga668008457910e916ebadf15bda2e5b29).



## Hardware Requirements and Setup

This library has been written for the Arduino platform and has been successfully tested on many boards. See [Boards where this library has been successfully tested](https://pu2clr.github.io/SI4735/#boards-where-this-library-has-been-successfully-tested)


### Arduino 5V and Si4735

* __THE SI4735 IS A 3.3V PART. IF YOU ARE NOT USING A 3.3V VERSION OF ARDUINO or another board, YOU HAVE TO USE A KIND OF 5V-3.3V BIDIRECTIONAL CONVERTER. Also pay attention to the appropriated pinout of your board to select the correct interrupt (IRQ- if you are using), RST, SDIO and SCLK pins. The table below shows some Arduino board pinout.__

### Schematic

The schematic below is a basic reference implementation which can be used to test the functionality of the Si4735 Arduino library. If you wish to build a more polished radio suitable for real-world use, you should consider making some improvements to the supporting circuitry.
[Click here to see a complete set of schematics and tips](https://pu2clr.github.io/SI4735/extras/schematic)

The image below shows a version of Silicon Labs SSOP Typical Application Schematic connect to the host MCU (Arduino Pro Mini 3.3V). __Pay attention to the Si4735-D60 SEN pin (16). When the SEN pin is connected to the ground, the I²C bus address is 0x11. When the SEN pin is connected to +3.3V, the I²C bus address is 0x63. By default, the "Si4735 Arduino Library" uses the 0x11 I²C bus address (SEN pin connected to GND). If you want to use the address 0x63 (SEN connected on +3.3V), see the functions (methods) getDeviceI2CAddress, setDeviceI2CAddress and setDeviceOtherI2CAddress__.

* The SI4735-D60 and SI4732-A10 have SSB patch support
* __See some Shortwave antenna configuration on__  [Si47XX ANTENNA, SCHEMATIC, LAYOUT, AND DESIGN GUIDELINES; AN383](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/application-notes/AN383.pdf)

* __Pay attention to the appropriated Arduino pinout to select the correct interrupt (IRQ), RST, SDIO and SCLK pins. The previous table shows some Arduino board pinout__.  
* __Be sure about the pinout of your device and Arduino connections. For example: the Si4735-D60/Si4730_D60 SEN pin (16 on SSOP version and 6 on QFN version) when connected to the ground, the I²C bus address is 0x11. When this pin is connected to +3.3V, the I²C bus address is 0x63__. See the functions [getDeviceI2CAddress](https://pu2clr.github.io/SI4735/#getdevicei2caddress) and [setDeviceI2CAddress](https://pu2clr.github.io/SI4735/#setdevicei2caddress) to correct setup. If you follow the schematic used in this project, you do not need to do anything (the default I²C bus address is 0x11). If you do not know how this pin is configured on the board, use [getDeviceI2CAddress](https://pu2clr.github.io/SI4735/#getdevicei2caddress).

### Defined Data Types and Structures

Working with the Si47XX family requires interacting with internal data. In order to simplify the maintenance and usage of the library, some structures and data types had to be defined. Each created data structure is listed below along with a reference to its documentation and the source material page. These data types greatly simplify the necessary handling of bits and bytes which the Si47XX family relies upon for commands, properties, and their appropriate responses. __The reason we do this is to separate code from data.__

All data types defined in Si4735 Arduino Library are explained [here](https://pu2clr.github.io/SI4735/extras/apidoc/html/)

### Public methods 

This library was developed using the C++ language and the Object-Oriented Programming approach. Methods are functions that belong to the class, in this case SI4735 class. Click [here](https://pu2clr.github.io/SI4735/extras/apidoc/html/group__group01.html) to go to API documentation.

All methods defined in Si4735 class are explained [here](https://pu2clr.github.io/SI4735/extras/apidoc/html/). The list below refers to the method groups implemented by the Si4735 class.   


#### Si47XX device setup and startup

Methods of this group are useful to configure the way that the Si47XX devices have to be initiate. 


#### Firmware Information

Allows to query the part number, chip revision, firmware revision, patch revision and component revision numbers.

#### Current Status 

The Si4735 class has a set of methods to query the current frequency, RSSI, SNR, multipath, and the antenna tuning capacitance value (0-191).

#### Current AGC Status

Methods to query AGC status.  Returns whether the AGC is enabled or disabled and it returns the gain index. 


#### Si4735 filters configuration

The SI4735 class has a set of methods to setup filters on AM and SSB mode.

#### Audio 

Methods to setup the audio mode (Digital or Analog), volume, mute etc. 

### RDS

This library implements some RDS features of the SI4735. All functions to deal with RDS are documented [here](https://pu2clr.github.io/SI4735/extras/apidoc/html/group__group16.html). Below you have some videos showing the RDS functionalities implemented by the PU2CLR Si4735 Arduino Library.

__ATTENTION:__ 
While utilizing interrupts is often the preferred approach for capturing RDS messages, applications using Arduino based on ATmega328 face limitations as they can only utilize two pins for interrupts (D2 and D2). These pins are typically allocated for encoder control, leaving no interrupt-capable pins available for FM/RDS application control. In such scenarios, resorting to the polling approach becomes necessary for retrieving RDS messages.

The code below shows the polling approach to get RDS messages.

```cpp

#include <SI4735.h>

#define RESET_PIN 16 // Arduino Nano / UNO pin A2

SI4735 rx;
void setup()
{
  rx.setup(RESET_PIN, FM_FUNCTION);
  rx.setFM(8400, 10800, currentFrequency, 10);
  delay(500);
  rx.setRdsConfig(3, 3, 3, 3, 3);
  rx.setFifoCount(1);
}


char *utcTime;
char *stationName;
char *programInfo;
char *stationInfo;

void showStationName() {
  if (stationName != NULL) {
    // do something
  }
}

void showStationInfo() {
  if (stationInfo != NULL) {
    // do something
  }
}

void showProgramaInfo() {
  if (programInfo != NULL) {
    // do something
  }
}

void showUtcTime() {
  if (rdsTime != NULL) {
    // do something
  }
}

void checkRds() {
 // The char pointer variables above will be populate by the call below. So, these variable (pointers) need to be passed by reference (pointer to pointer). 
 if (rx.getRdsAllData(&stationName, &stationInfo , &programInfo, &rdsTime) ) {
      showStationName(stationName); // you need check if stationName is null in showStationName
      showStationInfo(stationInfo); // you need check if stationInfo is null in showStationInfo
      showProgramaInfo(programInfo); // you need check if programInfo is null in showProgramaInfo
      showUtcTime(rdsTime); // you need check if rdsTime is null in showUtcTime
 }
}

void loop()
{
  .
  .
  .
  if (rx.isCurrentTuneFM()) {
    checkRds();
  }
  .
  .
  .
  delay(5);
}
```



### SI4735 Patch Support for Single Side Band

The SI4735 class implements a set of methods to apply patches and deal with SSB mode. All API documentation about patches can be seen [here](https://pu2clr.github.io/SI4735/extras/apidoc/html/group__group17.html).

The SSB patches used in some examples of this library were tested only on SI4735-D60 and SI4732-A10 devices.  __The updates used in those examples are unlikely to work on other SI47XX devices__.

__First of all, it is important to say that the SSB patch content is not part of this library__. The patches used with test purpose here were made available by Mr. [Vadim Afonkin](https://youtu.be/fgjPGnTAVgM) on his [Dropbox repository](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/xzofrl8rfaaqh59/AAA5au2_CVdi50NBtt0IivyIa?dl=0). Also, on Silcon Labs website, [support and community](https://www.silabs.com/community/audio-radio/forum.topic.20.10.html/ssb_and_or_ask_fskn-nJpo), there is a topic called "__SSB and/or ASK/FSK/nPSK demodulation on Si radio chips__". If you follow that topic, you will see a post from a member called "__DASM__" making available a [link to a patch](https://www.silabs.com/content/usergenerated/asi/cloud/attachments/siliconlabs/en/community/groups/audio-radio/forum/jcr:content/content/primary/qna/ssb_and_or_ask_fskn-nJpo/lookattachment_p216-Fwrr/si4735_patch.txt) for the SI4735-D60 and SI4732-A10. The structure of this file is a bit different if compared with Vadim's files __amrx_6_0_1_ssbrx_patch_full_0x9D29.csg__ and __amrx_6_0_1_ssbrx_patch_init_0xA902.csg__. However, they have the same idea and can be easily adjusted for patching. If you have some experience with C, all you have to do is follow the recommendations of the SI47XX PROGRAMMING GUIDE AN332; page 219.

PLEASE NOTE THAT THE AUTHOR OF THIS LIBRARY DOES NOT ENCOURAGE ANYONE TO USE THE SSB PATCHES CONTENT FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES. __IN OTHER WORDS, WHILE THIS LIBRARY SUPPORTS SSB PATCHES, THE PATCHES THEMSELVES ARE NOT A PART OF THIS LIBRARY__.

#### What does SSB patch mean?

In this context, a patch is a piece of software used to change the behavior of the SI4735-D60 and SI4732-A10 device.

There is little information available about patching the SI4735-D60 and SI4732-A10. The following information is the understanding of the author of this project and it is not necessarily correct.

A patch is executed internally (run by internal MCU) of the device. Usually, patches are used to fix bugs or add improvements and new features over what the firmware installed in the internal ROM of the device offers. Patches for the SI4735 are distributed in binary form and are transferred to the internal RAM of the device by the host MCU (in this case, Arduino boards). Since the RAM is volatile memory, the patch stored into the device gets lost when you turn off the system. Consequently, the content of the patch has to be transferred to the device every time the device is powered up.

I would like to thank [Mr Vadim Afonkin](https://youtu.be/fgjPGnTAVgM) for making the SSBRX patches available for
SI4735-D60 on his [Dropbox repository](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/xzofrl8rfaaqh59/AAA5au2_CVdi50NBtt0IivyIa?dl=0). On this repository you have two files, __amrx_6_0_1_ssbrx_patch_full_0x9D29.csg__ and __amrx_6_0_1_ssbrx_patch_init_0xA902.csg__.  Please note that the patch content of the original file is in const hexadecimal representation in an ASCII text file. If you are not using C/C++ or if you want to load the files directly to the SI4735, you must convert the supplied hexadecimal constants into their numerical equivalents.

##### For example: 

| Hexadecimal C/C++ constant | Binary representation | Decimal representation | 
| -------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- | 
| 0x15                       | 00010101              |  21                    |
| 0x01                       | 00000001              |   1                    |
| 0xFF                       | 11111111              | 255                    |



__ATTENTION__: The author of this project cannot guarantee that procedures shown here will work in your development environment. Proceed at your own risk.
    This library works with the I²C communication protocol to send an SSB extension PATCH to SI4735-D60 and SI4732-A10 devices. Once again, the author disclaims any
    and all liability for any damage or effects this procedure may have on your devices. Procced at your own risk.

All methods/functions to deal with SSB on Si4735-D60 can be seen [here](https://pu2clr.github.io/SI4735/extras/apidoc/html/group__group17.html).

### EEPROM support

Depending on your MCU memory size, to use SSB mode may not be possible due to the large amount of memory required by the patch. To solve this problem this library implemented the function __downloadPatchFromEeprom__. This function reads the patch content from an external EEPROM and transfers it to the SI4732-A10 or SI4735-D60 devices. To run this function you must have an external I2C EEPROM device configured with your MCU and the Si4732/35 device on I²C bus. Also, the EEPROM must have the patch content generated by the sketch SI47XX_09_SAVE_SSB_PATCH_EEPROM stored in it. [See folder TOOLS](https://github.com/pu2clr/SI4735/tree/master/examples/TOOLS/SI47XX_09_SAVE_SSB_PATCH_EEPROM).

The example [SI4735_06_SSB_EEPROM](https://github.com/pu2clr/SI4735/tree/master/examples/SI47XX_01_SERIAL_MONITOR/SI4735_06_SSB_EEPROM) shows this functionality on an Arduino Pro Mini. 

The example [SI47XX_03_SSB_Tiny4kOLED](https://github.com/pu2clr/SI4735/tree/master/examples/SI47XX_05_ATTINY85/SI47XX_03_SSB_Tiny4kOLED) implements this functionality on an ATtiny85.

To store the SSB patch content into an external EEPROM connected to your MCU via I2C bus, you need to run a special sketch first to program the EEPROM. [See sketch SI47XX_09_SAVE_SSB_PATCH_EEPROM](https://github.com/pu2clr/SI4735/tree/master/examples/TOOLS/SI47XX_09_SAVE_SSB_PATCH_EEPROM). 

__Attention__: The full ssb patch needs about 16KB on eeprom.  __All data that you have stored before into your eeprom device will be lost after the execution of the sketch SI47XX_09_SAVE_SSB_PATCH_EEPROM__.  

__The EEPROM device used for testing was the AT24C256 Serial I²C Interface__

#### SAVING RECEIVER STATUS INTO THE INTERNAL EEPROM


You can store useful receiver data into the internal Arduino EEPROM. Current band information, Bandwidth, step, mode, audio volume and filter are examples of data that can be stored into the internal EEPROM and restored when you turn the receiver on again. See the section [Storing data into the internal EEPROM before shutdowning](extras/schematic#storing-data-into-the-internal-eeprom-before-shutdowning) for details.

### Digital Audio support 

First of all, passive Crystal and digital audio modes cannot be used at the same time on SI47XX devices. The document Si47XX ANTENNA, SCHEMATIC, LAYOUT, AND DESIGN GUIDELINES; AN383; rev 0.8; page 6; you will find the following note: "Crystal and digital audio mode cannot be used at the same time".  So, for Digital Audio, you have to remove the crystal, and capacitors connected to the crystal from the circuit. 

This library supports the external clock reference and has implemented the digital audio functions. 
You can configure digital audio and external clock reference by using the functions: __setup, radioPowerUp, digitalOutputFormat, digitalOutputSampleRate, setRefClock and setRefClockPrescaler__. 

The schematic below shows the Digital Audio setup using an SI4735-D60 with an ESP32 Devkit. 

![SI473X and external active crystal oscillator or signal generator](extras/images/schematic_basic_active_crystal_osc_digital_audio_esp32.png)


You can check the schematic above via [SI47XX_06_ESP32/DIGITAL_AUDIO_SERIAL_PLOTTER example](https://github.com/pu2clr/SI4735/tree/master/examples/SI47XX_06_ESP32/DIGITAL_AUDIO_SERIAL_PLOTTER)


The table below shows how to wire the SI4735, DAC MAX98357A, and ESP32

### Customizing PU2CLR Arduino Library

Maybe you need some Si47XX device functions that the __PU2CLR SI4735 Arduino Library__ has not yet implemented. Also, you may want to change some existing function behaviors. This topic describes some approaches to consider if you wish to add new SI473X features to your application.


__Please, check the [API documentation](https://pu2clr.github.io/SI4735/extras/apidoc/html/) before implementing something you think is new. It is possible that what you want has already been implemented__. 

####  Primitive Functions
This library has primitive functions that make it easier for you to implement commands that may not have been implemented yet. The methods [setProperty, getProperty sendCommand, getCommandResponse and getStatusResponse](https://pu2clr.github.io/SI4735/extras/apidoc/html/group__group10.html) can be used to setup the SI473X devices directely. They can also be useful to check some features of the SI473X devices. To use those methods you have to be guided by the ["AN332 Si47XX PROGRAMMING GUIDE REV 1.0"](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~traylor/ece473/data_sheets/AN332.pdf) and __AN332 REV 0.8 UNIVERSAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE AMENDMENT FOR SI4735-D60 SSB AND NBFM PATCHES__ Silicon Labs documentation.  If you are familiar with bit operators in C / C ++, you will have no problem in using the above functions. 

The example below configures the GPIO by sending the 0x81 (GPIO_SET) command(AN332 Si47XX Programming guide page 195). 

```cpp

SI4735 rx;
uint8_t args[] = {0b00001010} // will set the GPIO 1 and 3 to high
uint8_t response[0]

.
.
.

rx.sendCommand(0x81,1,args);
.
.
rx.getCommandResponse(1,response);
.
.
.

```

#### Extending the SI4735 class

The best way to customize the PU2CLR SI4735 Arduino Library for your needs is extending the current version of the library by using C++ OOP approach. For example: 

```cpp
#include <SI4735.h>
class MyCustomSI4735 : public SI4735 { // extending the original class SI4735
  public:
    // New functions / methods
    int methodA() {    // some SI47XX command that PU2CLR SI4735 Arduino Library does not implement
      return 0;
    }

    int methodB() {    // another SI47XX command that PU2CLR SI4735 Arduino Library does not implement
      return 1;
    }

    // Overwriting existent methods
    void setTuneFrequencyAntennaCapacitor(uint16_t capacitor) { 
      // Here, your setTuneFrequencyAntennaCapacitor code that will replace the original code 
      // Tip: currentFrequencyParams is a protected member of SI4735 class and can be referred in your code
      currentFrequencyParams.arg.ANTCAPH = 0;         // it is just an example 
      currentFrequencyParams.arg.ANTCAPL = capacitor; // it is just an example 
      return;
    }

    void reset() {
      /// your reset code that will replace the original reset code 
      pinMode(resetPin, OUTPUT);
      delay(1);
      digitalWrite(resetPin, LOW);
      delay(50);
      digitalWrite(resetPin, HIGH);
    }
};

MyCustomSI4735 radio; // the instance of your custom class based on SI4735 class

void setup()
{
  Serial.begin(9600);
  while (!Serial);
  Serial.println("Customizing Si4735 class example.");
  radio.setup(12, 0); // Arduino pin 12 as reset and FM mode (0)
  radio.setFM(8400, 10800, 10390, 10); 
  // Setting the tune capacitor with your code instead Si4735 library code.
  radio.setTuneFrequencyAntennaCapacitor(100);
  // Calling new functions implemented by you.
  Serial.println(radio.methodA());
  Serial.println(radio.methodB());
}

void loop() {
  // Your code with your custom SI4735 library.
}
```

If you use that approach, all you have to do is download the current version of PU2CLR SI4735 Arduino Library. Instead of using the PU2CLR SI4735 Arduino Library class directly, you can use your own class that extends the original class. This way, you always have the current version of the library customized for your needs. So, no extra work will be needed when you update the PU2CLR SI4735 Arduino Library. In other words, your custom code will always be synchronized with the PU2CLR SI4735 Arduino Library code.


__Please, check the [API documentation](https://pu2clr.github.io/SI4735/extras/apidoc/html/) before implementing something you think is new. It is possible that what you want has already been implemented__.

### Tips to build 

* Try to follow what Silicon Labs recommends
* Start building the minimum circuit and test it
* Check if the Si47XX RESET pin (15 on SSOP version or 5 on QFN version) is connected on your MCU (Arduino) pin defined as RESET the (most of schematics and examples of this project this pin is the digital pin 12)
* Use the minimum sketch to test the minimum circuit. The first three examples of this project (see  examples folder) can be used to test the minimum circuit
* Try not improvising the I²C bus connection. Start using a 3.3V MCU (Arduino Pro Mini 8MHz or DUE,  ESP32 or other 3.3V device) to connect with SI4735
* If you are using the __Arduino Pro Mini__ 3.3V board, select the correct __Processor__ on Arduino IDE (ATmega328, 3.3V, 8MHz)
* Select the correct pullup resistor. Two variables to consider: the internal pullup resistors in some micro controllers, and the capacitance of the I²C bus. Some devices can enable or disable their pullup resistors. However, the bus capacitance is not easy to measure. As a result, it might be difficult to calculate the correct resistor value. To find a usable resistor value, start with a high pullup resistor to I²C bus and then reduce it until the best value. For example: start with 10K and try to reduce the value to 4,7K, 3,3K, 2.2K etc. Select the lowest resistor you can.
* I²C bus devices are available in different speeds. If you are using an I²C display device, check if its speed is compatible with the Si47XX and also with the current speed used by the master MCU
* Using different voltage levels between I²C devices can be unsafe and can destroy parts connected on I²C bus, specially the Si47XX
* It is important to wire all your I²C devices on the same common ground. 
* If you are using Arduino Mini Pro, UNO or similar, pay attention to the pin 13 and the use of an internal pull-up resistor. This pin has a LED and a resistor connected on the board. When this pin is set to HIGH, the LED comes on. If you use the internal pull-up resistor of the pin 13, you might experience problems due to the voltage drop caused by the LED circuit. If this occurs in your project, you can do: 
  *  Use the pin 14 instead pin 13. This pin is the A0 (Analog). But you have to refer it by 14 to use it as digital pin
  *  Change the circuit and sketch to use external pull-up on pin 13
  *  Remove the LED or resitor connected to the LED from the board.   
* Use only batteries to power your circuit. Receptions in LW, MW and SW can be interfered with by power supplies connected to the grid. 
* See some Shortwave antenna configuration on [Si47XX ANTENNA, SCHEMATIC, LAYOUT, AND DESIGN GUIDELINES; AN383](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/application-notes/AN383.pdf)

## Most Frequent Problems

### The system does not start.

Depending on your setup, the system can hang at the beginning. 

It has been observed in several tests. Some tips:

1. Avoid using a computer connected to the mains during testing. The electrical grid can disturb the communication between the Arduino based board and the SI47XX device
2. The RESET pin is not configured properly. Check the connection of the SI47XX pin 15 (RST) and the Arduino based board
3. Try to use a 22K pull-up on Arduino Board pin used for resetting (RESET PIN). It may be needed if you are using some Arduino based boards like (Atmega32, Atmega128 etc)
4. If the SI47XX pin 16 (SEN) is grounded, the I²C bus address must be 0x11, otherwise it must be 0x63 (the default I2C bus address is 0x11). Preferably, keep this pin grounded
5. Check if the pins 17 (SCLK / SCL) and 18 (SDIO / SDA) of the SI47XX device are correctly connected to the Arduino board pins
6. Check the pull-up resistors connected to the pins 17 (SCLK / SCL) and 18 (SDIO / SDA) of the SI47XX device
7. Check the voltage on SI47XX pin 15 (RST).  It should be 3.3V. All digital pins of your Arduino must have 3.3v when in HIGH condition. If it is greater than 3.3V, probably you are using an 5V board
8. If you are using the Arduino Pro Mini 3.3V (8MHz), be sure you selected the correct board on Arduino IDE Tools menu, Processor: __"Atmega328P (3.3V, 8MHz)"__. By default, the Arduino IDE uses the 5V processor version
9. Do not try to power an ATmega328 Arduino Board designed to work with 5V and 16MHz with a 3.3V supply. That configuration will make your system unstable. See [ATmega328P Datasheet](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-7810-Automotive-Microcontrollers-ATmega328P_Datasheet.pdf) 
10. Do not try to power your Arduino based board designed to work with 3.3V with greater voltage. See the technical specifications of your Arduino Board and remember that the maximum voltage of the SI47XX MCU CONTROL INTERFACE is 3.6V
11. Check the external crystal and its capacitors connections. 

__Attention__: The pins numbers above is considering Si473x-D60(SSOP) package.



### On FM mode, the receiver jump from a station to another station without any action.

If you are using Arduino Mini Pro, UNO or similar, pay attention to the pin 13 and the use of on internal pull-up resistor. This pin has a LED and a resistor connected on the board. When this pin is set to HIGH, the LED comes on. If you use the internal pull-up resistor of the pin 13, you might experiment problem due to the voltage drop caused by the LED circuit. If this occurs in your project, do one of the following:
  *  Use the pin 14 instead of pin 13. This pin is the A0 (Analog). But you have to refer it by 14 to use it as digital pin
  *  Change the circuit and sketch to use external pull-up on pin 13 or
  *  Remove the LED or the resitor connected to the LED from the Arduino Board.   

### After power up or try to tune the receiver, the display shows LW and 0 kHz

This problem can be a little complicated to solve. It can occur in many situations. I have observed that very few times in my experiments: 
 
* When I am powering the system using the computer USB and the computer is connected to the grid, it might occur. __Please, test your system using only batteries__.
* If you are using the Arduino Pro Mini 3.3V (8MHz), be sure you have selected the correct board on the IDE Tools menu, Processor: __"Atmega328P (3.3V, 8MHz)"__. By default, the Arduino IDE uses the 5V processor version.
* Check if the RESET pin of the SI473X and the controller are well connected.  
* This problem also can be caused by the external crystal connected to the SI473X device (in general 32768K). This crystal needs a minimum delay to become stable after a reset or power up command. Currently, this delay is 10ms. Try to increase that delay by using the method setMaxDelayPowerUp.

__Example:__

```cpp
void setup() {
 
 si4735.setMaxDelayPowerUp(500); // now the delay after power up will be 500 ms
 si4735.setup(RESET_PIN, FM_FUNCTION);

}
```


* Also, for some reason, the frequency switching needs a little delay (the default value is 30ms).  Try to increase that delay by using the method setMaxDelaySetFrequency.

__Example:__

```cpp
void setup() {
  si4735.setMaxDelaySetFrequency(50);
  si4735.setup(RESET_PIN, FM_FUNCTION);
}
```

* __Finally, if no previous attempt could not solve the issue, check that the crystal is working correctly__.


### I cannot tune satisfactorily to any station on LW, MW or SW

* Please, use only batteries to power your system up on LW, MW or SW 
* Check your circuit on AMI pin of the Si47XX device
* Keep as far as possible from noise sources (LED light bulb, computers and any device connected to the power grid)
* Try to find a suitable size for the antenna wire. Too long can be a big noise pickup. If too short, it may not be enough to pick up radio stations.
 

### When the receiver starts or when I switches it from FM to AM and vice-versa, I have loud click in the speaker  

Some users may be uncomfortable with the loud popping of the speaker during some transitions caused by some Si47XX device commands. This problem occurs during the receivers transition from the power down to power up. Every time the user changes the mode (FM to AM or AM to FM, Si47XX devices must be powered down and powered back up which causes the click sound. 

The SI473X devices have HIGH DC (DC bias) component in the analog audio output pins (SI4735-D60 pins 23 and 24). When the device goes to power down mode, the voltage on the audio pins drops to 0V. The device does it internally and there is no way to avoid that. When the device goes to power up, those audio pins suddenly go to the HIGH DC again. This transition causes the loud pop in the speaker. So far, the author of this library has not found an internal SI473X device solution to solve the loud popping of the speaker. The internal SI473X mute or volume commands will not stop the clicking sound. However, it is possible to solve this problem by adding an extra __mute__ circuit and control it by the MCU (Atmega, ESP32, STM32, ATTiny85 etc). 

The schematic below shows this approach.

<BR>

![Mute circuit](extras/images/schematic_mute_circuit_eagle.png)

Considering that you are using a MCU based on Atmega328. When the D14 (A0) is HIGH the Si47XX output audio will be drained to the ground. At that condition, no audio will be transferred to the amplifier input and, consequently, to the speaker. So, no loud click in the speaker. 

When the D14 is LOW, most of signal audio output from the Si47XX will be transferred to the input of the amplifier. 

The code below shows all you have to do in your sketch to implement this resource.


```cpp

#include <SI4735.h>
#define AUDIO_MUTE 14      // Pin A0 - Switch AGC ON/OF

Si4735 r;

void setup() {
  .
  
  // It is all you have to do to control an external audio mute circuit if you have one. 
  r.setAudioMuteMcuPin(AUDIO_MUTE); // Tells the system to control an external audio mute circuit. 

  r.setup(RESET_PIN, -1, 1, SI473X_ANALOG_AUDIO); // Starts on FM mode and ANALOG audio mode. 
  .
  .
  .

} 
```

{% include audiomute.html %}


Some low power audio amplifiers IC also implement a mute circuit that can be controlled externally. You can find this resource on __[LM4906](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm4906.pdf), [LM4863](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm4863.pdf?ts=1588602798363), KA8602B, MC34119, PAM8403__ and __HT82V739__ devices.

## Saving Memory on ATmega328 applications

* Use [MiniCore](https://github.com/MCUdude/MiniCore) board setup instead regular Arduino Atmega328 setup. You can save about 1KB by removing the bootloader and using LTO option
* You can also use the regular Arduino setup and use the hex file without bootloader (use xloader application in this case)
* Do not use the String class, sprintf or dtostrf functions to format numbers. Use itoa function or your own implementation to convert number to char array. You can save about 2KB.  See example below.

```cpp
/**
  Converts a number to a char string and places leading zeros. 
  It is useful to mitigate memory space used by sprintf or generic similar function
*/
void convertToChar(uint16_t value, char *strValue, uint8_t len)
{
  char d;
  for (int i = (len - 1); i >= 0; i--)
  {
    d = value % 10;
    value = value / 10;
    strValue[i] = d + 48;
  }
  strValue[len] = '\0';
}
```

__TIP:__ The SI4735 Arduino Library has a function to format numeric values like frequency, bfo, rssi etc. See [convertToChar documentation](https://pu2clr.github.io/SI4735/extras/apidoc/html/group__group18.html#ga133ec11bfc2c68100b47a63da4484767)


Example:

```cpp
.
.
.
void showFrequency()
{
  char freqDisplay[10];

  if (band[bandIdx].bandType == FM_BAND_TYPE)
  {
    rx.convertToChar(currentFrequency, freqDisplay, 5, 3, ','); // Formats the FM frequency
  }
  else
  {
    if (band[bandIdx].bandType == MW_BAND_TYPE || band[bandIdx].bandType == LW_BAND_TYPE)
      rx.convertToChar(currentFrequency, freqDisplay, 5, 0, '.'); // Formats LW and MW frequency
    else
      rx.convertToChar(currentFrequency, freqDisplay, 5, 2, '.'); // Formats SW frequency
  }
  showValue(0, 0, oldFrequency, freqDisplay, 2, 11);
}
.
.
.

```

* Regarding SSB patch, use the __patch_ssb_compressed.h__ and [downloadCompressedPatch](https://pu2clr.github.io/SI4735/extras/apidoc/html/group__group17.html#gaf1b8947db928728ada66ef3edaa79e76) instead __init.h__ and [downloadPatch](https://pu2clr.github.io/SI4735/extras/apidoc/html/group__group17.html#gafd1343bd8b4f0c290ef81c418222036c). It will save about 1K of memory.  

Explanation: The first byte of each line of the original patch content is either a 0x15 or 0x16 command. To shrink the patch size stored on the controller, the first byte on each line is omitted. Since the first byte on each line is either 0x15 or 0x16, it is not necessary to explicitly store them. Since most lines start with the 0x16 byte, only the line numbers beginning with 0x15 must be stored. The downloadCompressedPatch method will insert the value 0x15 when it's on a line that is marked as beginning with 0x15, and will insert 0x16 on all other lines.


```cpp 

#include <patch_ssb_compressed.h> // SSB patch for whole SSBRX initialization string

const uint16_t size_content = sizeof ssb_patch_content; // See ssb_patch_content.h
const uint16_t cmd_0x15_size = sizeof cmd_0x15;         // Array of lines where the 0x15 command occurs in the patch content.



void loadSSB()
{
  .
  .
  rx.setI2CFastModeCustom(500000);
  rx.queryLibraryId(); // Is it really necessary here? I will check it.
  rx.patchPowerUp();
  delay(50);
  rx.downloadCompressedPatch(ssb_patch_content, size_content, cmd_0x15, cmd_0x15_size);
  rx.setSSBConfig(bandwidthSSB[bwIdxSSB].idx, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1);
  rx.setI2CStandardMode();
  .
  .

}
```

1. More about ESP boards on [ESPRESSIF Development Boards](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/development-boards).
2. More about BlueDuino on [Seed](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Blueduino-Rev2-Arduino-compatible-pius-BLE-CC2540-p-2550.html).
3. On [Arduino.cc](https://www.arduino.cc/) you can see the technical specification about many board. 
4. It seams that in some ESP32 board, the I²C bus is not configured properly by default. However, you can set almost any pin on ESP32 to setup I²C capabilities. All you have to do is call __Wire.begin(SDA, SCL);__ where SDA and SCL are the ESP32 GPIO pins. See the folder examples to check how to use ESP32 devices. 
5. You can use the pin 12 too.  
6. Arduino Nano 33 BLE only supports 3.3V I/Os and is NOT 5V tolerant so please make sure you are not directly connecting 5V
signals to this board or it will be damaged. Also, as opposed to Arduino Nano boards that support 5V operation, the 5V pin does NOT
supply voltage but is rather connected, through a jumper, to the USB power input.

2. Although the SI4730-D60 does not officially support SW, several tests performed during the development of this library, as well as tests performed by other experimenters, it was observed excellent performance of this IC on HF/SW band. See "Si47XX PROGRAMMING GUIDE; pages 2 and 3; Table 1 - Product Family Function" for more details. See the video [Si4730-D60 ultimate testing (FM/RDS + LW + SW)](https://youtu.be/lRYE854EOrk). __It is important to note that the author of this library does not guarantee all SI4730-D60 devices sold on the market will work in LW and SW bands and FM with RDS as well__.

3. __Digital Audio setup (I²S) did not work during the tests.__

#### Protoboard

The basic circuit built on protoboard is based on the “__SSOP Typical Application Schematic__”, suggested by the Silicon Labs Documentation (Si4730/31/34/35-D60-BROADCAST AM/FM/SW/LW RADIO RECEIVER; page 19). Two pull-up 4.7K resistors were added on I²C bus (It is an arbitrary value. Actually, this value may vary depending on your devices connected to the bus). Also, it is recomended to add two 4.7uF capacitors between the CI audio output and audio amplifier. The photos below do not show these capacitors. See  [C7 and C8 on schematic](https://pu2clr.github.io/SI4735/#schematic).

<BR>

The figure below shows a suggestion to shrink the prototype and connections. If you are just doing prototyping, I recommend this approach due to the short connections with the Si4735 (recommended by the manufacturer).

![Mini Protoboard 01](./extras/images/SI4735_mini_protoboard_01.png)

The configuration above connected to Arduino Pro Mini is shown below.

The following photo shows the most common prototyping approach. Use this approach if you don't want to solder the components on the adapter plate.
